# ForeverLearn
## Context
This project includes the realization of two Bachelor's Degree Final Project, a first one for Software Engineering that proposes a base platform and a second one for Computer Science that expands and completes the work done in the first one.

The project will be developed by myself, José Justo Tena Agudo, with the mentoring of my tutor Oriol Borrás Gené, from whom the original idea comes from.
## Description
MOOCs, as their acronym indicates, are massive open online courses that seek to bring education to the widest possible audience. In our case we will focus on CMOOCs, a variant that focuses on the knowledge community that can arise by taking advantage of the large volume of students in this type of courses, but presents the difficulty of evaluating students not based on the content learned but on their contribution to the community, it was due to this difficulty that they fell into oblivion without ever having a real implementation.

ForeverLearn seeks to create a virtual space that allows its users to teach, search and enroll in CMOOCs, which will be accompanied by a forum system in which students can discuss, clarify their doubts and expand the course content. Students will be graded based on their participation in these forums, which will be incentivized through a gamification system that will give them different levels of privileges.

The project is thus divided into two main parts: firstly, a virtual classroom where the courses are created, stored and accessed, and secondly, a forum system that expands them and will serve as to evaluate the students.
